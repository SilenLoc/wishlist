# UPLIFT V2 Commercial Standing Desk

## Why I want this

After spending most of my day sitting at a computer, I've started experiencing back pain and want to incorporate more standing into my work routine. A standing desk would allow me to:

- **Improve posture** - Alternate between sitting and standing
- **Increase energy** - Standing can help maintain alertness
- **Better health** - Reduce the risks associated with prolonged sitting
- **Customizable height** - Electric adjustment for perfect ergonomics

## Specifications

- **Height range**: 25.3" to 50.9"
- **Desktop options**: Various sizes and materials available
- **Weight capacity**: Up to 355 lbs
- **Motor**: Dual motor system for smooth adjustment
- **Memory settings**: 4 programmable height presets

## Why Medium Priority

While this would significantly improve my work environment, it's a larger investment that requires some planning. I want to make sure I have the right space setup and budget allocated properly.

## Setup Considerations

- **Space**: Need to measure current desk area
- **Accessories**: May need monitor arms and cable management
- **Transition period**: Will need time to adjust to standing routine
- **Ergonomics**: Might need an anti-fatigue mat

## Health Benefits

Research shows that standing desks can:
- Reduce back pain
- Lower blood sugar levels
- Improve mood and energy
- Potentially reduce risk of heart disease
