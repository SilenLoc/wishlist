# Keychron K2 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard

## Why I want this

I've been using a basic membrane keyboard for years, and it's time to upgrade to something that will improve my typing experience. The Keychron K2 seems perfect because:

- **Wireless connectivity** - Both Bluetooth and USB-C options
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works seamlessly with Mac, Windows, and Linux
- **Hot-swappable switches** - I can customize the typing feel later
- **Compact 75% layout** - Saves desk space while keeping function keys

## Specifications

- **Layout**: 75% compact with function keys
- **Switches**: Gateron mechanical switches (multiple options)
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth 5.1 + USB-C wired
- **Battery**: Up to 240 hours (backlight off)
- **Build**: Aluminum frame with adjustable typing angle

## Why This Priority

This is a high priority item because I spend 8+ hours a day typing, and a quality keyboard is an investment in both comfort and productivity. The wireless feature will also help keep my desk clean and organized.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Logitech MX Keys** - Good but not mechanical
- **Das Keyboard** - Great but more expensive
- **Anne Pro 2** - Cheaper but smaller layout
