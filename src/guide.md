# How to Use This Wishlist

This wishlist is designed to be a living document that should help other find gifts for me

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between different categories and individual items. Each category contains items that are related in purpose or use case.

## Priority System

### 🔴 High Priority
Items I actively want to purchase soon. These usually solve an immediate problem or significantly improve my daily workflow.

### 🟡 Medium Priority  
Items that would be nice to have but aren't urgent. I'm waiting for the right time, better price, or clearer need.

### 🟢 Low Priority
Future considerations or "dream" purchases. These might be expensive items or things I don't have an immediate use for.
