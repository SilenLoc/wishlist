> A thoughtful exploration of moral character through biographical portraits of historical figures including Dwight Eisenhower, Dorothy Day, and Augustine. Brooks contrasts 'résumé virtues' (career success and wealth) with 'eulogy virtues' (kindness, bravery, honesty), arguing that modern culture overemphasises external achievement whilst neglecting the inner life. A call to cultivate humility, self-discipline, and moral depth.
