> A charming collection of letters exchanged between New York writer Helene Hanff and Frank Doel, a London bookseller, from 1949 to 1969. Their correspondence about rare books evolves into a warm friendship across the Atlantic. A delightful celebration of books, letter-writing, and human connection in the post-war era.
