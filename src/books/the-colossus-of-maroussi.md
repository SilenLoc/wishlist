> Henry Miller's lyrical travel memoir about his journey through Greece in 1939. Often considered his best work, it's a celebration of Greek culture, landscape, and the writer's encounter with the charismatic Greek writer George Katsimbalis (the 'Colossus'). A vivid portrait of Greece on the eve of World War II and a meditation on art, life, and human vitality.
