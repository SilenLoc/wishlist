> Originally published anonymously, Nature was the first modern essay to recommend the appreciation of the outdoors as an all-encompassing positive force. Emerson's writings were recognised as uniquely American in style and content, and launched the idea of going for a walk as a new way of looking at the world. A foundational text of American transcendentalism that celebrates the spiritual connection between humanity and the natural world.
