## Why Low Priority

While absolutely cool and unique, this is more of a novelty item than a necessity. It's something I'd love to have for the wow factor, but other items on my wishlist provide more practical value. Perfect for when I want to treat myself to something fun.

## Use Cases

### Home Decoration

## Technical Considerations

### Plant Selection
- **Air plants (Tillandsia)** - Perfect choice, no soil needed
- **Small succulents** - Need minimal soil, very lightweight
- **Artificial plants** - Zero maintenance, always looks perfect
- **Small moss arrangements** - Creates zen garden effect

### Placement Requirements
- **Stable surface** - Base needs to be level and vibration-free
- **Power access** - Requires nearby electrical outlet
- **Safety clearance** - Keep away from electronics and magnetic storage
- **Lighting** - Consider plant's light needs for positioning

## Maintenance

### Electronics
- Dust base regularly to maintain clean appearance
- Check power connection periodically
- Keep away from moisture and extreme temperatures

### Plants
- Mist air plants 1-2 times per week
- Rotate plant occasionally for even growth
- Monitor for any signs of stress from magnetic field

## Alternatives Considered

- **Traditional hanging planters** - Cheaper but less impressive
- **Hydroponic systems** - More practical but not as visually striking
- **Smart planters with sensors** - More functional but lacks the levitation wow factor
- **Geometric wall planters** - Stylish but doesn't float

## Investment Rationale

This is purely for enjoyment and aesthetics. It's the type of item that brings daily joy and never fails to impress visitors. While not practical, it represents the intersection of technology and nature that I find fascinating.

## Future Integration

Could be part of a larger smart home ecosystem:
- Coordinate lighting with plant care schedule
- Integrate with home automation for scheduled operation
- Combine with other magnetic levitation decor items for a cohesive theme
